# [Uni Assignment] eHouse

<b>A Servlet + JDBC + JSP real estate web app made for university/educational purpose.</b><br>
Database used: MySQL.<br>
The app allows you to register an account (+login/logout/delete) and to publish ads about houses.<br>
The backend includes a good backbone for future improvements (admin support etc).<br>
<b>Being an university project this app is not in a final state. It is posted here as a storage solution, and it might get updated in the future if I might want to dive deeper in java technologies for web, but for now it is DISCONTINUED.</b>
